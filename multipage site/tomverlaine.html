    <p>Verlaine was born Thomas Joseph Miller in Denville, New Jersey, on December 13, 1949.[1] His father, Victor Andrew Miller[2] (1921–2008), was of Lithuanian heritage (originally Miliszauckas[3]), but born in Coatbridge, Scotland.[4] His mother, Lillian (Lilya) Barbara Dopko(wski)[5] (1921–2005) was originally from Pennsylvania and of Polish heritage. Tom's father worked first as a maintenance man[3] and later as a sales manager.[2] Tom had a twin brother, John Peter Miller[2] (1949–1984), who died suddenly at age 34.[6]</p>

    <p>Tom moved to Wilmington, Delaware, with his family when he was six.[7] He began studying piano at an early age, but switched to saxophone in middle school after hearing a record by Stan Getz. Jazz saxophonists such as John Coltrane and Albert Ayler inspired him.[8] Verlaine initially was unimpressed with the role of the guitar in both rock music and jazz, but was inspired to take up the instrument after hearing the Rolling Stones' "19th Nervous Breakdown" during his adolescence,[9] at which point he began a long period of experimentation to develop a personal style. A later musical influence of Verlaine's became jazz musician Miles Davis' electric-period recordings, particularly the Japanese LPs Agharta (1975) and Dark Magus (1977), which he was able to obtain as imports.[10]</p>
   <p>Tom's family sent Verlaine and his twin brother John to Sanford Preparatory School, a private boarding school in Hockessin, Delaware. While John excelled in athletics and graduated in 1967,[11] Tom's interest leaned toward writing and poetry. At Sanford, Tom became friends with future bandmate and punk icon Richard Hell (Richard Meyers).[12] They quickly discovered that they shared a passion for music and poetry. Neither Verlaine nor Hell graduated from Sanford and they later moved to New York City.

   <p>In New York City, Miller created his stage name, a reference to the French symbolist poet Paul Verlaine. Regarding the name change, rather than the poet being a source of inspiration, Verlaine said, "I just like the sound of the name”.[13] He and Hell formed the Neon Boys, recruiting drummer Billy Ficca.[14] The Neon Boys quickly disbanded after failing to recruit a second guitarist, despite auditions by Dee Dee Ramone and Chris Stein. They reformed as Television a few months later,[14] finding a guitarist in Richard Lloyd, and began playing at seminal punk clubs like CBGB and Max's Kansas City. In 1975, Verlaine kicked Hell out of the band for his erratic playing and behavior, and they released their first single with Fred Smith replacing Hell. Verlaine dated poet and musician Patti Smith when they were both in the burgeoning New York punk scene. Television released two albums, Marquee Moon and Adventure, to great critical acclaim and modest sales before breaking up in July 1978.[14] </p>
