        The Digital Songs or Digital Song Sales chart (previously named Hot Digital Songs)[1] ranks the best-selling digital songs in the United States, as compiled by Nielsen SoundScan and published by Billboard magazine. Although it originally started tracking song sales the week of October 30, 2004,[2] it officially debuted in the issue dated January 22, 2005, and merged all versions of a song sold from digital music distributors.[3] Its data was incorporated in the Hot 100 three weeks later. Since October 2004, digital sales have been incorporated into many of Billboard's music singles charts.[4] The decision was based on the dramatic increase of the digital market while commercial single sales in a physical format were becoming negligible.[5]</p>
    <p>The first number one song on the Digital Songs chart was "Just Lose It" by Eminem.[2] </p>
