        <p>I got this vintage lamp one year from my Grandma. I spent a lot of time with my Grandma growing up and she was always the most generous with gifting. I was in elementary school and remember that I asked my parents not to get me anything, because there was nothing that I needed. But, they decided that this was something special that I would like. I have used and loved it ever since.</p>
